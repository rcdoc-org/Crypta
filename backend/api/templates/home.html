        <p class="lead mb-4">
          In the spirit of our Catholic mission—to evangelize, serve, and unite the Body of Christ—we’re pleased to introduce a demo of our new diocesan portal.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          This demonstration environment highlights:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled mb-4">
          <li>✅ An <strong>enhanced filtering &amp; sorting system</strong> to find parishes, schools, and resources instantly</li>
          <li>✅ A dedicated <strong>Parish Portal</strong> for streamlined communication and sacramental scheduling</li>
          <li>✅ Complete <strong>flexibility</strong>—we can add any feature you need, from ministry calendars to volunteer sign-ups</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-5 text-muted">

              <strong>5-12-2025: Added Export to CSV and Excel</strong><br>
              The action buttons for exporting to excel and csv are now live!<br>
              It will export as result.csv/xlsx and only give you the filtered results and 
              choosen columns by the user.<br><br>
              <strong>5-12-2025: Added count to email recipients in email confirmation</strong><br>
              We now have a total recipients item in the email confirmation page for sending emails.
              This will make it easier to confirm the number of emails being sent out prior to sending.
              <br><br>
              <strong>5-12-2025: Created a Dynamic Details Page</strong> <br>
              We now have a dynamic details page that allows you to see the details of 
              the selected person. It does have logic started for locations but is not 
              fully functional with data yet. <br><br>
              <strong>5-12-2025: Added Search Filters</strong> <br>
              We now have a search input bar that allows you to search for filters by name.
              This doesn't search the filter tree names but the values available 
              in the filter tree groups. <br><br>
              <strong>5-10-2025: Added Column Chooser</strong> <br>
              We now have a column chooser modal that allows you to select which columns you want to see in the results. <br><br>
              <strong>5-8-2025: Header & GUI Updates</strong> <br>
              We have updated the header to be more user friendly and match more with workday example provided by Adam Padron. <br/><br/>
              <strong>5-5-2025: Introduced Action Buttons</strong> <br>
              You'll find place holders for exporting to excel, csv, and mailing labels. <br>
              But the Send email option is under live development and already has a working attachment system and body expansion setup. <br>
              Link to page: <a href="{% url 'api:enhanced_filter' %}">Links</a>
              <br/><br/>
              <strong>4-25-2025: Entire Filtering & Sorting System Operational</strong> <br>
              You can find the enhanced filtering system here: <a href="{% url 'api:enhanced_filter' %}">Links</a> <br/>
              You'll find it more user friendly and similar to Amazon purchasing experiences. <br>
